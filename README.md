# eslint-config-hayanmind

### Motivation

There are various projects in progress in HayanMind. As different teams work on different projects, each project has different lint rules, which resulted in different coding styles between teams. It can reduce the efficiency of development team. For example, different coding styles make it difficult to review other developers' code. To prevent this, HayanMind maintains a consistent coding style within the development team through a single lint rule. Through a consistent coding style, we hope to improve the collaborative experience among HayanMind developers and increase the efficiency of development team.
